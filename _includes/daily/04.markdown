- if you have not done so already, go to Piazza and vote for the date of the midterm exam 

- start looking for Wikipedia articles to which you can contribute (these could be small edits that fix broken links or typos, or something much more significant if you feel ready for it); next week you will need to include links to your edits in the blog posts 

- make your next post (due Feb. 4, midnight), try to discuss the following ideas:
    - explain (in your own words) the difference between software development following
    the cathedral model and software development following the bazaar model; which
    of the two environments would you be more comfortable
    - _The Cathedral and The Bazaar_ essay has 19 "lessons"; pick two that you found most
    interesting, intriguing, telling, or that you simply liked; quote them in your blog and try
    to explain what they are supposed to mean

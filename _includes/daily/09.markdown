- Website fixes discussion
    - who should verify that the submitted changes work? when should it be verified? 
    - who tested their changes before submitting a pull request? 
    - how do we test changes in general? 
    
- Contributions going forward:
    - each small contribution earns you 1 point
    - goal for the end of the semester 20 points for small contributions (you can
    make more of them, of course)
    - what are contributions: 
        - report issues (can be for the course website, but they need to be
        non-trivial and you cannot be the one solving it), 
        -comment on issues (can be for the course website related issues, but
        they have to be substantial comments suggesting fixes and such), 
        - solve course website related issues and submit a PR that is accepted, 
        - contribute to WikiMedia projects, 
        - contribute to OpenMaps project, 
        - contribute to any Open... non-code writing project 
    - limitations:
        - max of 8 points can come from course website related contributions
        - max of 5 points can come from Wikipedia related contributions 
    - balance so far:
        - most of you have a one Wikipedia contribution (1 point)
        - most of you have three course website contributions: 
            - report an issue (1 point), 
            - comment on an issue (1 point),
            - create a pull request for a fix (1 point), 
    - whenever you make a small contribution, add it as a last entry in that week's blog
    under the heading __My Contributions This Week__ - the listing should contain description
    of your contribution and a link to it 
    
    
    

- The [etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/ossd_projects) for today's class. 

- In your group, work on the assigned project:
    - locate information about contributing to the project
    - as you go through the process, have one team-member enter comments
    on the eherpad under your team's name (the comments should describe the steps you
    followed, if they worked or not, and if they did not, what happened) 
    - one team-member should start working on installing the development environment (this may be trivial or
    complicated depending on the project) - make sure you include the descriptions of steps and issues
    you encounter on the etherpad 
    - look through the labels used in the project, find a label that suggests that it is a good
    issue for beginners and then locate all the issues with that label 
    - pick one of the issues from the previous step, add a link to it to the etherpad, study the issue, if
    it is is a bug, are you able to reproduce it, if it has not been verified, try to verify it, if nobody commented
    on it, see if you can add a constructive comment 
    - repeat the previous step for a few issues

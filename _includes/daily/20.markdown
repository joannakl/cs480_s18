Blog posts for this week:

- report on the rescheduled open data week events, if you attended any

- a reflection on the invited talk: what do you think about the Google's approach to open source

- report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team

- Visit the [code of conduct document](https://golang.org/conduct) for the Go project. Read the document
and explain the benefits of having such a document for a project. Do you think other projects would benefit from
having such document? Does the project that your team is working on have a code of conduct document. If so,
post the link to it.

- You should also update your "contributions" table with any new contributions
(do not include the team work in there).

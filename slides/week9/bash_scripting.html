# a shell script

- A _shell script_ is a text file containing a set of commands that are executed
in order they are written in the script.

- The script works with a particular shell ( _bash_ shell scripts, work with _bash shell_).

- A _shell_ is basically the command line interface.

- The _shell scripts_ are usually small programs that automate various tasks.


---
# running basic commands

- almost anything you type at the terminal is a _bash_ command
(well, some of them may be names of the programs to run, other's may be operating system's
tools, but a large number of things that happen are either _bash_ commands or _bash_  scripts)

- examples

  ```
  echo "Hello World"
  echo $(whoami)
  ```
--

  ```
  which bash
  ```
--

  ```
  du -sh
  ```
---
# first script

- create a file consisting of the following lines

```
echo "Hello World"
echo $(whoami)
which $(whoami)
```

- name the file `first`
--

- in a terminal window (running bash), execute:

```
  sh first
